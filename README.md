# mars-challenge

I've attached the data used for this challenge along with the two parts of the assignment. 

In part 1 is the article titles from the mars data website that was extracted, along with a brief summary of what the article is about. 
Part 2 we take a deeper look at the mars weather data from the Curosity rover and compare it with the data from Earth. Looking at temp differences, days for one orbital period, change in temps in each month and how the temps vary.
